    "des1": "Currently, the app only supports any token with a <a  href='https://docs.chain.link/docs/ethereum-addresses/'>Chainlink price feed</a>. We‚Äôre planning to broaden token support significantly in version 2.",
    "title2": "How are the tokens priced?",
    "des2": "Each token is priced based on its <a   href='https://docs.chain.link/docs/ethereum-addresses/'>Chainlink price feed</a> with a Taker Discount, so they can cover gas costs, and a Protocol Fee for using the service. The Taker Discount and Protocol Fee are dynamic so check our Discord for the latest numbers. We are working hard to bring these numbers down close to zero of time.",
